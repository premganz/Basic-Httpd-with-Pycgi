# Basic-Httpd-with-Pycgi

The idea of this repository is to demonstrate using httpd via a simple configuration file and a python cgi script.
It contains the httpd.conf and a py.cgi script, you would need to install httpd, place the document root directory and cgi-bin direcotries in
your machine.
You would also have to install Python and related libraries for this cgi.
